Installation/ Preparation:
- acquire python2.7 and sqlite3
- install the packages subprocess32 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/subprocess32/ and texttable https://pypi.python.org/pypi/texttable
- download this project
- acquire TIGER, NEGRA, and any corpus in CoNLL-X shared task format

To run an experiment you have to create a configuration file:

TODO!

Then (assuming python ~ python2.7) run 'python dependency_experiments_db.py run-experiment path/to/configuration/file'.

This command will start the experiment, the program outputs certain information to stdout.
Also, it writes the results in the experiment database.

In order to list the contents of the experiment database run

python evaluate.py path/to/database list

In order to generate a LaTeX file containing a table with various statistics run

python evaluate.py path/to/database plot --experiments=$SELECTION

where $SELECTION is a list of natural numbers seperated by ',' or '-', 
where each natural references a row in the table
and 'n-m' expands to 'n,n+1, ..., m-1,m' where 'n' needs to be smaller than 'm'.
The order in the this list specifies the order in the generated table.
